# SeismicSaliency_ICIP2017

## About the Paper

This directory contains all source codes and data used to produce the results published in the following paper:

M. A. Shafiq, Z. Long, T. Alshawi, and G. AlRegib, “Saliency detection for seismic applications using multi-dimensional spectral projections and directional comparisons,” IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), Beijing, China, Sep. 17-20, 2017.

## How to Run

1. In Matlab, make this directory as the working directory.

2. Make sure you add following directory in your Matlab search path by 
   using "Set Path" and "Add with Subfolders" in the Matlab Home-Environment 
   tab: "..\Seismic_Data\"

3. Run the program:

   >> Main.m
   
   to generate saliency map for seismic image and reproduce results of the paper.
